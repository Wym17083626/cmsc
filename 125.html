Pete Thamel recently <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/13/sports/ncaafootball/13luck.html?ref=sports">sat down with Luck</a> to discuss the decision, how the Cardinal will do now that Jim harbaugh is no longer coach and what it&#8217;s like to run into Condoleeza Rice on campus.</em> </p> <div class="q left">Q.</div> <p> Archie Manning told me that you talked to Peyton before you made your decision. I think your mind was pretty well made up, but what insight did he give you?  </p> <div class="a left">A.</div> <p> I was shaking in my shoes talking to him. He said a couple real helpful things. One is that not to look back. Don’t change the way you’ve done anything after you make the decision. You can’t worry about injuries. You can’t worry about things you wouldn’t have worried about, or you’re going to get caught not playing as hard as you can or doing something different. He said you’ve obviously been successful to this point, so just keep working hard and don’t expect things to be easy now. He recounted a story where his first game back they were playing a not-great opponent, a warmup game. On his first drive he threw an interception. He thought it was just going to be six or seven touchdowns a game. Obviously I’m going to try and avoid thinking like that. I’m sure that it’ll creep into my mind, some thought of complacency. You have to realize that you’re going to have to put more work in to be successful. Especially with Stanford being in the position we are now. We’re not sneaking up on anyone. Don’t get complacent and don’t worry about injuries were two of the many points that he made.  </p> <div class="q left">Q.</div> <p> Did he give you a sense of, ‘I really think I made the right decision?&#8217;  </p> <div class="a left">A.</div> <p> He said he didn’t regret it at all. He said something to the effect of, &#8220;Your first year in the N.F.L. you’re going to be bad. No matter what. If you’re drafted high or higher, your team is probably going to be bad. You have that pick for a reason. You’re going to struggle.&#8221; But he said that he didn’t think he would have made the leaps or the progress into his second year without another year in college and having success come that quick. What did he go like 3-13 and 13-3 or something? He said he felt a lot more comfortable going into that. He said, ‘If you’re not ready to move on with life if it’s the best choice.’<br /> <span id="more-29375"></span></p> <div class="q left">Q.</div> <p> I know you went to the Manning Passing Academy, did you get his number from that?  </p> <div class="a left">A.</div> <p> I met him over the summer and Aaron Morehead is on our staff who played wideout for the Colts for a couple years. Ron Turner was an offensive coordinator here for like two days and then left for the Colts and his son is on the staff as an offensive assistant. So Aaron and both Morgan Turner, Ron Turner’s son, told me Peyton said to give him a call if you want. I was like, &#8220;Of course I’m going to give him a call.&#8221; But I wasn’t going to call him out of the blue and disrupt what he does to prepare.  </p> <div class="q left">Q.</div> <p> And you got to know the family a bit, too?  </p> <div class="a left">A.</div> <p> Archie is very nice. He would send me texts after games congratulating me. What an awesome family. What a classy family.  </p> <div class="q left">Q.</div> <p> From talking to all your friends and family the past couple of days, they said you derive more joy in others’ accomplishments than your own. Where does that come from?  </p> <div class="a left">A.</div> <p> I was raised that way. My mom and dad were like that. They were always excited when I did something well growing up. I figured they’re my role models, why not be excited when people I care about or friends or teammates do something good, my sister does something good? I guess it goes back to attracting attention to yourself. I was always taught, my dad said two things growing up. &#8220;Money doesn’t grow on trees, and when someone toots your horn it sounds twice as loud.&#8221; Those are the two things. I took that to heart.  </p> <div class="q left">Q.</div> <p> Why were you so fired up when your roommate, Griff Whalen, got put on scholarship and when Owen Marecic finished 10th in the Heisman Trophy race?  </p> <div class="a left">A.</div> <p> For Griff, my roommate, its awesome to see a guy you live with basically get a $50,000 check for school. I’m sure his parents are working hard to support him in that. I’m obviously excited, he’s one of my best friends. For Owen, he’s just an awesome guy. To see an old-school guy get some recognition form some writers out there, I don’t know. It’s good to see your buddies enjoy success. It’s good for them.  </p> <div class="q left">Q.</div> <p> Was the Heisman weekend uncomfortable for you?  </p> <div class="a left">A.</div> <p> I think it was more uncomfortable for Cam than Kellen, LaMichael and I (laughs). I learned a lot last year and this year about what comes with being a successful quarterback on a successful football team. When you’re getting attention for winning and people are thinking highly of you as a football player. I’ve got used to dealing with that. I tried to go on the Heisman trip and the trip to Orlando for the awards show saying, &#8220;O.K., I’m going to have to do media obligations and I’m going to have to do this and that. But I’m just going to enjoy it.&#8221; I think we all assumed that Cam was going to win. There was a little less pressure. I just tried to enjoy it and make the most of it. Who knows if you’re ever going to get back. It’s a once-in-a-lifetime thing.  </p> <div class="q left">Q.</div> <p> I don’t want to jinx you by saying that you would have a catastrophic injury, so say that the N.F.L. lockout lasts 10 years, what would be your chosen profession?  </p> <div class="a left">A.</div> <p> I’d love to get into architecture. I think that I’d need some more schooling in it. Maybe. Maybe not. Or sports business. My dad has been in sports business since I grew up. I grew up going to N.F.L. Europe games five hours early and sitting at a tailgate waiting for people to come. Listening to him talking about the different problems. Me and my mom were always more worried about how many tickets sold than he was. So either architecture or sports business.  </p> <div class="q left">Q.</div> <p> When you got here, Tavita Pritchard was the starting quarterback. People told me it was pretty obvious that you were physically more gifted than him your true freshman year yet were his biggest supporter. What was dynamic like your redshirt freshman year?   </p> <div class="a left">A.</div> <p> It was difficult not playing, redshirting, when you’re used to playing. But I think it’s the same for every college athlete. They’ve started on every team they’ve played on and are used to being the best in all the sports that they played. I realized that I wanted to help the team. If I was going to pout and moan as a freshman, wouldn’t I get any respect from older guys if I did end up starting? If I was more physically gifted, I didn’t know half as much as Tavita did about football. I had a lot to learn and to grow. If I was going to get respect from the guys, I would have to keep my mouth shut and work hard, do the grunt work. I just tried to embrace the role of scout team quarterback and tried to get better though that and make our defense better.  </p> <div class="q left">Q.</div> <p> My favorite thing anyone has told me here the past couple days is that you used to lead the student section in cheers of “Vamos, Vamos, Stratford,” during high school. You obviously go to games here to support your sister and other friends. What do you enjoy about that?  </p> <div class="a left">A.</div> <p> Anytime you get to enjoy another athletic event without having to play in it, I enjoy that. I enjoy sitting down and watching football games, even if I’m not playing in it. When you play a sport you respect what other athletes have to go through and playing for Stanford I feel very blessed to wear the Stanford on the jersey. It’s nice to go out and see other people represent Stanford in their different athletic venues and support them like they supported us. I’ve always been a big fan of sports. Competition is great. It brings out the best in people. It’s sort of funny to see the different pressure that different sports put on the athletes and how pitchers handle it, how gymnasts handle it, how basketball players handle shooting a free throw in a tough situation. That’s interesting to me.  </p> <div class="q left">Q.</div> <p> Do you still lead the cheers?  </p> <div class="a left">A.</div> <p> (Smiles). No, I don’t.  </p> <div class="q left">Q.</div> <p> Is the crowd somewhere you can blend in?  </p> <div class="a left">A.</div> <p> It&#8217;s obviously nice to go to games at Stanford. Obviously I’ve been recognized a lot more lately than I used to. No one is overbearing. They don’t disturb you. If a kid wants an autograph, that’s fine. I love to make a kid’s day and help a kid. If people want pictures that’s fine, they’re very respectful. No one has ever interrupted a conversation that I’ve been having with someone. You definitely can blend it at Stanford. It’s nice.  </p> <div class="q left">Q.</div> <p> How have you been able to help your sister’s adjustment here? She said she likes that you have a car.  </p> <div class="a left">A.</div> <p> That’s pretty much all she calls me for.  </p> <div class="q left">Q.</div> <p> What kind of car is it?  </p> <div class="a left">A.</div> <p> A Honda Accord. I drove it out here from Texas with my dad. It was an awful drive. Good mileage, though.  </p> <div class="q left">Q.</div> <p> Is it nice to have her here? </p> <div class="a left">A.</div> <p> We’ll go to dinner every now and then and just hang out. I try to give her some words of wisdom where I messed up on. Things to avoid. I try and stay out of her way as much as I can. I don’t want to be the overbearing brother that sees her out in social functions and embarrasses her.  </p> <div class="q left">Q.</div> <p> She told me a great story about her dropping all the water bottles in her second volleyball game.  </p> <div class="a left">A.</div> <p> I felt bad for her, but I couldn’t help but laugh.  </p> <div class="q left">Q.</div> <p> You told me last summer that you liked soccer, but the last couple days I found out just how much. You have very obscure taste in soccer jerseys from what I hear. Who is the Houston Dynamo’s guy jersey you would wear around?  </p> <div class="a left">A.</div> <p> Wade Barrett.  </p> <div class="q left">Q.</div> <p> In trying to show why you’re back here, I think that some of the little things you’ve done on campus, like play soccer against the members of the women’s team in the spring, is one of the neat little nuances. Talk about how that came to pass.  </p> <div class="a left">A.</div> <p> The community of athletes at Stanford is very unique. I’m sure it’s like a lot of other schools where athletes tend to hang out with athletes. But it’s cool to go and see an Olympic synchronized or play against the girls&#8217; soccer team that’s gone undefeated other than the last game the last two years. Just to hang out with them. It’s a lot of fun.  </p> <div class="q left">Q.</div> <p> I understand that you guys would beat them on the bigger field, but they could dominate you on the smaller field.  </p> <div class="a left">A.</div> <p> Technically, they’re way better than us. I think we’re just faster and bigger than them. They’re probably a little afraid to physically dominate and get the ball away from us.  </p> <div class="q left">Q.</div> <p> Can you give me a little window into your array of soccer jerseys?  </p> <div class="a left">A.</div> <p> I have a couple Dynamo jerseys because my dad worked for them. A Germany jersey, a Czech Republic team jersey, a USA jersey, a USA training jersey. We have a bunch at our house that just lay around because of my dad. I wouldn’t say I enjoy buying them. Most come to the house through my dad. If it’s an XL jersey, I’ll get it. If it’s smaller my sisters or little brother will get it. They just sort of show up through the house.  </p> <div class="q left">Q.</div> <p> You can still live a pretty private life here, right?  </p> <div class="a left">A.</div> <p> Absolutely, yeah.  </p> <div class="q left">Q.</div> <p> Talk a little bit about that. Inevitably, if things continue to go well, the rest of your life you’re going to have people grabbing at you. Do you relish the privacy here and is it going to be nice to have one more year in a little bit of a bubble?  </p> <div class="a left">A.</div> <p> I think so. It’s nice. I don’t think that really affected me when I was deciding. I figure it&#8217;s going to happen, so whatever. It&#8217;s nice being at Stanford, where I wouldn’t say people don’t care about you being a football player, but they’ve got more important things to worry about. They’re doing research, they’re trying to solve problems, doing P Sets, they’re Olympic athletes. The great thing about Stanford is that people respect each other. There’s a lot of respect between students because you know they’re successful in something. Respect for the student-athletes and students and athletes. All the kids are doing something great. No one makes a big deal about the starting quarterback. It happens once in a while, people may want a picture or whatever. But people are very gracious and not making a big deal out of it. They’re all studs in whatever field they’re in. What does it matter if someone is a stud in football?  </p> <div class="q left">Q.</div> <p> Give me some color about growing up in the Luck family.  </p> <div class="a left">A.</div> <p> Our parents were never intense about any one thing. They weren’t like, &#8220;If you don’t get this grade, you’re done.&#8221; They said, &#8220;Do your best, be respectful, don’t get in trouble and treat people kindly.&#8221; In sports, it was never, &#8220;You have to do this. You have to get a personal trainer.&#8221; It was, &#8220;If you sign up, you’re going to finish throughout the year. Just enjoy it. No pressure.&#8221;  </p> <div class="q left">Q.</div> <p> Your sister told me the story how when you guys would drive to Colorado you would make up songs?  </p> <div class="a left">A.</div> <p> We watched &#8220;The Sound of Music&#8221; like six times once. I hated it, but my mom’s sisters loved it. I’m trying to think of some other anecdotes.  </p> <div class="q left">Q.</div> <p> Mary Ellen told me that your parents never locked you in a room and made you study, that it happened more organically. Can you talk a bit about how they passively stressed education?  </p> <div class="a left">A.</div> <p> I think that I was encouraged to read books. We didn’t have cable TV in London or Germany growing up. I remember watching like &#8220;Tom and Jerry&#8221; but no other TV shows. The TV was off, so we were occupying our time playing sports outside or reading a book. I think my dad was working a lot overseas and my mom wasn’t, so she took a lot of opportunity to take us to museums if during the day my dad was working out of town. So I guess education was passively stressed by reading a lot instead of playing video games and watching TV.</p> <div class="q left">Q.</div> <p> I don’t want to harp on the decision that wasn’t a decision here.  </p> <div class="a left">A.</div> <p> No, that’s fine.  </p> <div class="q left">Q.</div> <p> You had said at the Heisman that you were going to sit down after the season. Did you actually take a couple days to think about it?  </p> <div class="a left">A.</div> <p> I didn’t want to make a decision and distract anyone on the team or preparing for the Orange Bowl and trying to finish a great football season. Maybe it wouldn’t have distracted the team at all, but I just didn’t want to make it about me before the game. It was a great year for Stanford, let’s keep it about Stanford football. I definitely wanted to make sure that I wasn’t missing out on something that could be really awesome for life. After the game I had a quick conversation with my dad and I had talked to him earlier before and my mom. &#8220;You sure you want to do this?&#8221; I was like, &#8220;Yeah, let’s do it. Why not?&#8221; (Laughs.) I think I knew pretty much all along what I was going to do. </p> <div class="q left">Q.</div> <p> Other than Peyton, did you call anyone else?  </p> <div class="a left">A.</div> <p> No. I told my buddies earlier that I’m staying.  </p> <div class="q left">Q.</div> <p> Griff Whalen said it was kind of like no one wanted to bring up the topic to you.  </p> <div class="a left">A.</div> <p> I could sort of tell. (Laughs.)  </p> <div class="q left">Q.</div> <p> He said he took context clues, like when you asked him about where you guys would live next year or you mentioned that you’d be taking a specific class next fall.  </p> <div class="a left">A.</div> <p> I could sort of tell, so I’d drop hints. (Laughs.)  </p> <div class="q left">Q.</div> <p> Did anyone in your circle or on your team or in the Stanford family tell you that you were dumb to risk the money? Or did they all kind of look at the palm trees and get it?  </p> <div class="a left">A.</div> <p> No one told me anything negative, and I don’t think they’d hesitate to tell me if they thought it was the wrong decision. I have a pretty good relationship with a lot of people where I don’t think I’m going to get offended if they say, &#8220;You’re messing up here.&#8221; They all said, &#8220;O.K., yeah. Sounds good.&#8221; But I probably would have said the same thing if I were them.  </p> <div class="q left">Q.</div> <p> Did you get any sense of the backlash out there that you made a so-called dumb decision?  </p> <div class="a left">A.</div> <p> No. It’s fine with me.  </p> <div class="q left">Q.</div> <p> Did you see your dad’s quote where he said that this is a Rorschach test for you value system?  </p> <div class="a left">A.</div> <p> (Laughs). I don’t like to read anything my dad says. (Laughs again.) It’s a little odd for me. I remember when we lived in Houston and he’d have a quote in The Houston Chronicle, we’d be like, &#8220;Ah, man. That’s dad again. Throw it away.&#8221; I didn’t see that.  </p> <div class="q left">Q.</div> <p> Do you agree with that notion?  </p> <div class="a left">A.</div> <p> I don’t know what a Rorschach test is.  </p> <div class="q left">Q.</div> <p> Good. I didn’t either. It’s like the old ink blot test, where one person sees an American flag and another sees a block of cheese or something.  </p> <div class="a left">A.</div> <p> Sure. I guess. I don’t know. I haven’t honestly read too much. I don’t know. I haven’t read into it too much. I made the decision and I’ll live with it. I don’t want to get into it too much.  </p> <div class="q left">Q.</div> <p> You dad told me that at the end of the day that you came back most to be with the guys you came in with and finish the job. Can you talk about the bond that this class has?  </p> <div class="a left">A.</div> <p> I don’t want to romanticize this class or make it into some huge drama, like we love each other. But we’re all great friends. Obviously like any class in football you’re going to have attrition due to transferring and injury and medical reasons and what not. But I think our team, 85 percent of the guys from that class start or are in a huge role on the team. I think a lot of guys have grown very close. Everyone but three people live in the same dorm. We’re all around each other a lot. We obviously have great relationships with everyone on the team. I think we came in at a time when Stanford wasn’t a national powerhouse and sort of took a leap of faith with Coach Harbaugh and what he was doing and Stanford football in general. We’re starting to reap the benefits of putting hard work in. I think we really want to finish this next year with Coach Shaw in the right manner and set him off in the right direction and finish what we started in the right way.  </p> <div class="q left">Q.</div> <p> Your sister told me that time management was something that’s been the hardest adjustment for her coming to college. It seems to be something you do well, as Griff said you seem to sleep 10 hours a night. Little things like buying a sandwich early before class, do you have to approach every day strategically time management wise?  </p> <div class="a left">A.</div> <p> I don’t know. You definitely learn freshman year what you need to do before. I probably shouldn’t have bought this sandwich early because it&#8217;s soggy now. It&#8217;s something that you get used to. I sort of get a little bit anal during football season to have enough time to not rush football and to be able to sit down and relax and get my homework done. I try to figure out how I can work my day out to where I can not do the least amount of schoolwork as possible, but just get it done so I don’t have to do anything extra and I can focus on football and still relax and stuff.  </p> <div class="q left">Q.</div> <p> Mike told me that one of your favorite quotes about workouts is, &#8220;We have to make it suck.&#8221; Is that kind of the glue to this class a bit, bonding over things like workouts?  </p> <div class="a left">A.</div> <p> Coach Harbaugh told us that a couple years ago, &#8220;We have to make this suck more.&#8221; When you start winning you start to get complacent, and you have to take it upon yourself to make things suck for you that much more so you can get better. Winning makes you soft, and we try and make it suck as much as we can. I’ve never been to another university. I’m sure everyone works out and everyone works out hard. Everyone has a special workout that they have to do that’s a character builder. I think we enjoy being around each other in those situations and having to push each other and trying to keep each other from failing or quitting. I don’t know if we do it any harder or easier than anyone else. But I think we enjoy being around each other in those situations.  </p> <div class="q left">Q.</div> <p> Mike told me that the guys tease you for being a dork, but he added that everyone at Stanford is a little weird in their own way. Do you take pride in being a little bit of a nerd?  </p> <div class="a left">A.</div> <p> Yeah, why not? Everyone at Stanford definitely has their quirks and their nerdy moments or dorky moments. Sure. Why not?  </p> <div class="q left">Q.</div> <p> What’s been the most gratifying academic thing you’ve accomplished here?  </p> <div class="a left">A.</div> <p> Probably getting a B in Engineering 14. That was probably the toughest class I’ve taken to date. I put in the work, went to office hours three times a week to try and understand the material. Professor Mitiguy is the guy who taught it. He really struck me as a guy who was like, &#8220;You don’t want to just know this stuff, you want to understand why certain things happen.&#8221; He didn’t want us to give him answers in a formula, he wanted us to be able to know why things happen. I took that to heart and I ended up getting a B, so I was happy.  </p> <div class="q left">Q.</div> <p> Was that the vector equation class where you went up and did the problem and got an ovation?  </p> <div class="a left">A.</div> <p> It was an easier problem. For some reason I had just read the chapter that problem was in before that class. That class, he’s very engaging with all his students. You don’t go the whole quarter without getting up on the board. Everyone has to get up at some point. It’s a big lecture, so it’s a big deal. I tried to stay prepared for when the time came. It wasn’t a stroke of brilliance or anything, I sort of knew it already.  </p> <div class="q left">Q.</div> <p> His M.O. is that when someone flips up a laptop he calls on them immediately?  </p> <div class="a left">A.</div> <p> When he sees a glowing Apple logo, you’ll get called on. He’s old school, which is awesome.  </p> <div class="q left">Q.</div> <p> Is it fair to say that during football, you tend to try and go a lighter academically?  </p> <div class="a left">A.</div> <p> I probably wouldn’t be at this university if it wasn’t for football, not to take anything away from the academic side of things. I love football a lot more than I like school (laughs). I definitely try and take a lighter load. But I don’t want to disrespect the academia of the university in any way. All of us on the football team, we try our best in school. During the season we’ll take lighter loads and easier classes to manage things.  </p> <div class="q left">Q.</div> <p> When you leave, what do you think you’ll miss the most?  </p> <div class="a left">A.</div> <p> Your buddies and everyone is going in different directions. You hit the real world and have a job, so that. The weather and setting. You’re hard-pressed to find a better environment than this one. I don’t know. I’ll try not to miss anything. You have to move on in life a lot of times.  </p> <div class="q left">Q.</div> <p> Aside from swimming in the fountain on an odd Friday, any other wacky Stanford stuff you’ve done?  </p> <div class="a left">A.</div> <p> There’s a lot of weird stuff that goes on this campus, as I’m sure you have figured out.  </p> <div class="q left">Q.</div> <p> Is it Princeton that has the naked runs?  </p> <div class="a left">A.</div> <p> I think a lot of schools have that. We don’t do that.  </p> <div class="q left">Q.</div> <p> So what are some little Stanford nuances?  </p> <div class="a left">A.</div> <p> I guess, meeting Condoleezza Rice and seeing her at 5:30 a.m. when you’re walking in the weight room and she’s working out. I got to meet George Shultz a couple of days ago. He was in the sports athletic medicine center. I didn’t know who he was, and someone was like, &#8220;Hey, he’s the last great American statesman.&#8221; I called my dad and said, “I met George Shultz.&#8221; He was like, &#8220;Wow. He was just a dude.&#8221; I’ve gotten to meet a lot of people like that, but I’ve forgot some. I had a mental list.  </p> <div class="q left">Q.</div> <p> Did you meet Steve Jobs? </p> <div class="a left">A.</div> <p> No, I didn’t. But his son goes to school here, and I’ve met him. The U.S. Ambassador to Japan, I’m in class with his kid. He was an honorary captain before the Orange Bowl for us. I met Ray Lane the Oracle C.O.O. and there’s just a bunch of people you get to meet. You get to meet a lot of neat people.  </p> <div class="q left">Q.</div> <p> You gave me a great quote this summer when I asked you about writing the perfect ending to your career. You said that you wanted to be known as part of the Stanford class that turned things around and won two Rose Bowls. Obviously you got an Orange Bowl, which I’m sure you’ll take. What’s the update to that now?  </p> <div class="a left">A.</div> <p> Same thing. Win a Rose Bowl. Be the first Pac-12 champion, and everyone knows that road leads through Oregon, so beating Oregon would be nice. But that’s no small task.  </p> <div class="q left">Q.</div> <p> Do you think there’s enough talent here to win the Pac-12 and have a shot at a national title?  </p> <div class="a left">A.</div> <p> Yeah. We’ve proven ourselves as a team that we are talented enough to compete with everybody and win every game. I’m sure probably 70 teams in N.C.A.A. college football believe that. I think we do have confidence. I think history has shown that if you do win the Pac-10 you do have a shot in playing in the big one. We know we have to win the league first. And if you go undefeated and win the league, that helps your chances that much more.  </p> <div class="q left">Q.</div> <p> Coach Shaw will be one of the most anonymous coaches in college football next year. Tell me about him a little bit.  </p> <div class="a left">A.</div> <p> I think he has no problem staying behind the scenes. He definitely cares about Stanford a lot and is very bright and a very sharp football mind. He’s been a great coach since I’ve been here. Everyone has the utmost respect for him as a coach and a person. He’s a good guy and he’s a little less eccentric and maybe a little less polarizing than the guy we had before, not to detract anything away from Coach Harbaugh or Coach Shaw. They’re definitely different personalities and go about it different ways. A lot of stuff will stay the same. He’s just solid with good character and he’s going to help us win football games.  </p> <div class="q left">Q.</div> <p> Is the feel going to change in the program? It almost has to a little bit, right?  </p> <div class="a left">A.</div> <p> Until we start practicing with pads on. We still have the same head strength coach, and that’s our father during the off-season. We haven’t filled the whole staff out. It’ll be interesting to see what the feel is.  </p> <div class="q left">Q.</div> <p> How much when you’re making the decision that wasn’t the decision, how much of Coach Harbaugh leaving or potentially leaving did that weigh in at all?  </p> <div class="a left">A.</div> <p> I think myself and all the other Stanford players figured he was going to do the best for he and his family. It’s not like he promised us anything ever he was going to be here for life. I don’t think he ever shortchanged us on anything as evidenced by the success we had. I don’t think any of us blamed him. If anything, we were happy he had the opportunity to do that.  </p> <div class="q left">Q.</div> <p> How much last year did you work with him? How much with Coach Shaw?  </p> <div class="a left">A.</div> <p> Coach Harbaugh was the quarterback coach, so he was in every meeting. In my three years here, I’ve talked to Coach Shaw a lot about the quarterback position. All the coaches have been in tune to the quarterbacks and what’s on their plate. He’s always had a big hand in the passing game and overall theme and direction of the offense. He’s coached me up every day since I’ve been here in a football sense.  </p> <div class="q left">Q.</div> <p> You guys were a bad half from playing for the national title. Is that driving you guys this off-season?  </p> <div class="a left">A.</div> <p> Everyone understands that if you want to do anything on the West Coast right now, you’re going to have to beat Oregon. They’re the benchmark program right now like U.S.C. was a couple of years ago. I’m sure everyone in the North Division is saying that we’re going to beat Oregon. I don’t think anyone dwelled on it too much. I think we understood that we lost fair and square. Sure we made some mistakes that weren’t characteristic of our team, but a lot of it was because of Oregon. They definitely beat us fair and square. They were a drive away from winning a national championship. I don’t think we dwell on it too much. It is a motivating factor.  </p> <div class="q left">Q.</div> <p> How have you seen the campus football culture change? Is there anything that nags at you that wishes the campus and community got behind you more?  </p> <div class="a left">A.</div> <p> Any competitor is going to want to have a full, rocking stadium to the brim with lots of energy. It doesn’t happen every time at Stanford. But it has changed a lot since I’ve been here. I remember going to games freshman year and I was like, wow, it’s like a high school game sometimes. Maybe we weren’t so competitive and that was part of it, I guess. I don’t want to slight the Midwest or anything, but we’re not in the Midwest, we’re in California and there’s stuff to do. There’s the beach and the mountains or whatever. There’s a lot of stuff to do. You can’t slight people. It was nice this year to see a packed house for U.S.C. and getting crowds for a lot of bigger games.  </p> <div class="q left">Q.</div> <p> It has to be gratifying to be part of the team that ended an era of apathy, though.  </p> <div class="a left">A.</div> <p> Absolutely. I’ll tell you one story that I think you’ll like. My freshman year I used to come back from the road. I was redshirting and I traveled. Kids would see me with my bags in the dorm and say, &#8220;Where were you?&#8221; I’d say, &#8220;Oh, we had a game this weekend.&#8221; They’d say, &#8220;How’d you do?&#8221; &#8220;Oh, well, we lost.&#8221; &#8220;Oh, when’s your next one?&#8221; &#8220;Well, we have one pretty much every weekend during the ball.&#8221; They’d say, &#8220;O.K. Good luck.&#8221; Now, that doesn’t happen. I don’t mean to pick on anyone, but football wasn’t a big deal. But now people are starting to recognize football players more.  </p> <div class="q left">Q.</div> <p> Can you give me the opposite spectrum anecdote? </p> <div class="a left">A.</div> <p> I get double takes in class if you’re sitting down a lot more. Stuff like that happens a lot more. A lot more congratulations if you’re on campus on Sunday or Monday and a lot more of, &#8220;Good luck this weekend.&#8221; It&#8217;s not just me, a lot of people have noticed it. If you’re in Palo Alto, people will come up to you at dinner.
