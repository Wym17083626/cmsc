Begg</title> <link>http://events.stanford.edu/events/281/28169</link> <guid>http://events.stanford.edu/events/281/28169</guid> <description> Date:  Ongoing every weekday (M-F) from May 16, 2011 through June 30, 2011.  10:00 AM.&lt;br/&gt;  Location: The Clayman Institute - Serra House&#13; 589 Capistrano Way&#13; Stanford&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  Artist Connie M. Begg's exhibition Curios brings together a group of  unusual art objects for display in the intimate setting of the Clayman  Institute. She most frequently works with antiquated photographic  technologies (such as the tintype process and pinhole cameras) to  produce images that reference her fascination with things from the past.  Begg is haunted by the realization that she cannot recall the years of  her own early childhood, and her impossible desire to reconnect with her  young self founds her uncanny and often uncomfortable photographs of  antique dolls, children&amp;#8217;s clothing, kids in masks, and artist  self-portraits.&#13; The exhibition will be available for view M-F 10am-4pm at The Clayman  Institute from May 16th-June 30th. Please join us for an open reception  on Friday May 20th from 4:00-6:00pm.

Through a three-quarter series of courses (BIO 196A,B,C), seniors in Biology and other life sciences were invited to undertake an exciting, in-depth creative project joining a powerfully compelling scientific subject with a passion in the arts.&amp;#160;The Senior Reflection enabled students to focus their projects on interesting and personally relevant issues in biology, to challenge and expand their own creativity and to engage the wider community in the creation and exhibition of an artistic project.&amp;#160;Senior Reflection projects in the first year include over thirty individual creative works across a variety of media: there are two works of short fiction, two documentary films, an experimental large-scale photograph and four collections of fine art in ink, watercolor, oil and mixed media.&amp;#160;&#13; Exhibition reception and film screening is Thursday May 26, 2011 from 4:00-7:00pm&#13; * * * * * * *&#13; GALLERY160 was opened in Fall 2010 in Wallenberg Hall as part of the Your Art Here Program. The gallery was founded jointly by the Stanford Institute for Creativity and the Arts (SiCa) and Wallenberg Hall.&#13; The Your Art Here Program coordinates several student-run gallery spaces across Stanford campus, enabling Stanford students to display their work. The program is run by a staff Oversight Board and a Student Committee, and gives students the opportunity to gain professional experience in curating, installing, and gallery management. Students are responsible for planning, curating, and installing the exhibitions, and are given training opportunities with professionals in the field.&#13; Learn more online at http://yourarthere.stanford.edu&#13; &amp;#160;</description> <pubDate>Thu, 26 May 2011 09:43:09 PDT</pubDate> </item> <item> <title>Tolstoy in 1910:  The Author Is Dead -- Long Live the Author!</title> <link>http://events.stanford.edu/events/276/27605</link> <guid>http://events.stanford.edu/events/276/27605</guid> <description> Date:  Tuesday, May 31, 2011.  12:00 PM.&lt;br/&gt;  Location: Encina Hall West, Room 208 (2nd floor)&#13; Stanford, CA 94305&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  Extending arguments raised in his recent book,&amp;#160;The Death of Tolstoy: Russia on the Eve, Astapovo Station, 1910, William Nickell will describe Tolstoy's place in the advent of modern celebrity in Russia.

Gordon on Ants</title> <link>http://events.stanford.edu/events/282/28245</link> <guid>http://events.stanford.edu/events/282/28245</guid> <description> Date:  Tuesday, May 31, 2011.  4:15 PM.&lt;br/&gt;  Location: Building 260, Room 113&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  Ant colonies operate without central control. &amp;#160;How does a colony regulate its behavior and adjust to changing conditions with nobody in charge?&#13; Deborah M. Gordon&#13; The regulation of foraging activity in harvester ant colonies&#13; Abstract:&#13; Ant colonies operate without central control and resemble large distributed systems. An ant&amp;#8217;s behavior depends on its recent experience of brief interactions with other ants. In the course of a brief antennal contact, one ant can assess the task of the other using odor cues. A long-term study of the behavior and ecology of harvester ants in the Arizona desert shows how colonies regulate foraging to balance the tradeoff imposed by spending water, while foraging in the desert sun, to obtain water, which is metabolized from seeds. The goal is not to send out more ants than are justified by the current food supply. The ants collect seeds that are widely scattered, each retrieved by a single ant without the use of pheromone trails. The duration of a foraging trip depends mostly on how long the forager had to search to find a seed. A forager leaves the nest on its next trip in response to the rate at which it meets foragers returning to the nest with food. Thus foraging activity is adjusted to food availability without any information about the location of food. I will discuss a model of the algorithm colonies use to regulate foraging, the ecological and evolutionary consequences of variation among colonies, and analogies to other distributed networks.&amp;#160;&#13; &amp;#160;&#13; About the Stanford Complexity Group:&#13; The mission of the&amp;#160;Stanford Complexity Group&amp;#160;(SCG) is to serve as an interdisciplinary forum for discussion of the findings, tools, and philosophical and cultural implications associated with the study of complex systems. This event represents the first in a series of talks in which experts discuss aspects of their complex systems of study.&amp;#160;To&amp;#160;hear about future events join our mailing list&amp;#160;here.&amp;#160;Read more about the SCG on our website:&amp;#160;&amp;#160;http://complexity.stanford.edu&amp;#160;</description> <pubDate>Wed, 25 May 2011 09:20:45 PDT</pubDate> </item> <item> <title>Film: "Little Angel, Make Me Happy"</title> <link>http://events.stanford.edu/events/269/26983</link> <guid>http://events.stanford.edu/events/269/26983</guid> <description> Date:  Tuesday, May 31, 2011.  7:00 PM.&lt;br/&gt;  Location: Building 200 (Lane History Corner), Room 030, Stanford, CA&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  "Little Angel" tells an intimate story within the larger historical context of the deportation of ethnic Germans from Turkmenistan to Siberia during the Second World War.

The adage &amp;#8220;you are what you eat,&amp;#8221; has never been more true as people struggle with poor health and obesity.&#13; Food is central to our lives and it&amp;#8217;s only natural for food to be the among the most effective mediums to initiate a change in consciousness. Conscious living spans all thoughts and actions and, living consciously begins with conscious eating.&#13; Food is the most basic necessity of life. Its purpose is to nourish the body, mind, and soul. It has the unique power to bring people together. All of us have had the experience of sitting down to a meal cooked with love and felt an immediate transformation of consciousness filling us with a sense of deep joy and happiness. Food that is old, decomposed, and consisting of dead flesh will pollute the body and consciousness. Food that is fresh, alive, and nutritious will, on the other hand, enrich the body, cleanse the mind, and satisfy the soul. When prepared with love, food can speak any language. Such food has the ability to break down barriers, turn anger into love, fear into trust, and ignorance into enlightenment. Conscious people live their lives in full awareness of their connection to their surroundings.</description> <pubDate>Fri, 08 Apr 2011 18:30:26 PDT</pubDate> </item> <item> <title>Maize another development &amp;#8212; without a germ line how do you get meiosis?</title> <link>http://events.stanford.edu/events/282/28271</link> <guid>http://events.stanford.edu/events/282/28271</guid> <description> Date:  Friday, June 3, 2011.  12:00 PM.&lt;br/&gt;  Location: Hopkins Marine Station, Monterey Boatworks Lecture Hall, Pacific Grove&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  18th Annual Lawrence R.

Most of the music that survives from the Middle Ages is spiritual in nature. A much smaller amount of secular music survives. Why? Because until quite late in the Middle Ages, when the earliest musical notation appeared, music was transmitted orally. The clerics who devoted their poetry to Mary and other Christian personalities, and the troubadours who wrote of love for gracious ladies were among the privileged few who learned how to read and write. Their legacy, painstakingly inscribed on vellum or parchment, contains all we have left of the musical riches produced during a period of nearly 1,000 years.</description> <pubDate>Fri, 27 May 2011 14:38:11 PDT</pubDate> </item> <item> <title>Stanford Breakfast Briefings</title> <link>http://events.stanford.edu/events/280/28037</link> <guid>http://events.stanford.edu/events/280/28037</guid> <description> Date:  Wednesday, June 15, 2011.  7:30 AM.&lt;br/&gt;  Location: Stanford Faculty Club 439 Lagunita Dr.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  In this session, Peter Sims, co-author of True North, and author or Little Bets,  reveals how the big ideas spring forth from a series of small  discoveries, reworked to achieve a great result.</description> <pubDate>Tue, 03 May 2011 15:28:54 PDT</pubDate> </item> <item> <title>Outdoor Science Talk 1 - Fuels from Sunlight : Converting Solar Energy</title> <link>http://events.stanford.edu/events/283/28309</link> <guid>http://events.stanford.edu/events/283/28309</guid> <description> Date:  Thursday, June 16, 2011.  7:00 PM.&lt;br/&gt;  Location: Lawn outside Cantor Arts Center&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  Please join us for Stanford&amp;#8217;s acclaimed Summer science lecture series on the lawn adjacent to Stanford&amp;#8217;s Cantor Arts Center on four Thursday evenings. You are invited to come early and wander through the museum, and have dinner at the Art Center&amp;#8217;s Cool Caf&amp;#233; or bring your own picnic. You can then settle on the lawn outside to hear informal lectures about cutting-edge research from four of Stanford&amp;#8217;s most esteemed professors. All of the talks will be delivered in terms understandable to the general public. So bring your entire family (high school age and up) and enjoy! The Outdoor Science Talks are sponsored by the Stanford Office of Science Outreach and Stanford Continuing Studies. Outdoor Science Talk 1 - Fuels from Sunlight: Converting Solar Energy In the 2011 State of the Union address, President Barack Obama specifically mentioned ongoing research activities in the area of converting sunlight into chemical fuels. Why are chemical fuels important? Chemical fuels currently account for more than 80 percent of worldwide energy consumption, predominantly in the form of fossil fuels (natural gas, petroleum, and coal). In this lecture, we will examine the prospects of moving away from these traditional sources and toward a clean and sustainable path to synthesizing similar molecules using solar energy. There are numerous challenges involved, bridging material science, chemistry, physics, and chemical engineering. We will address these challenges, and discuss some of the cutting-edge research currently under way at Stanford. Thomas Jaramillo Assistant Professor of Chemical Engineering Thomas Jaramillo&amp;#8217;s research interests include the design and synthesis of advanced nano-structured materials for catalyzing chemical transformations in energy conversion devices, particularly those involved in solar fuel synthesis. He received a PhD in chemical engineering from UC Santa Barbara.</description> <pubDate>Fri, 27 May 2011 14:38:00 PDT</pubDate> </item> <item> <title>Sunday Tour: Outdoor Sculpture Around the Cantor Arts Center</title> <link>http://events.stanford.edu/events/267/26721</link> <guid>http://events.stanford.edu/events/267/26721</guid> <description> Date:  Ongoing  from March 20, 2011 through December 18, 2011.
